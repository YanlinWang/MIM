> SUMMARY

> This paper presents an inheritance mechanism for typed languages that allows multiple inheritance
> with conflicting method names, as long as they stem from unrelated base classes. Following the
> approach of languages like C++, uses of a method can be disambiguated through the static type of the
> receiver. Moreover, ambiguous methods can also be overridden selectively, by disambiguating the

> The approach is formalised as an extension of Featherweight Java and proved sound.

> This paper is well-written and and focused on a single small problem: that of name clashes in OO

We think this suggestion is useful and valueble, we didn't think about this before. It does produce a
simpler method overriding semantics and definitely can be a future work..

Naturally renaming can break the subtyping relation, of course, there might be techniques as you said 
that tracks the rename mapping and keeps the subtyping relation, but that's the special case and we 
didn't discuss it in the paper.

In Section 2.1 we have mentioned the C++ qualified name approach, see Sec 2.1 -> Potential Fixes -> 
Static dispatch.

> - Related, it may be worth mentioning that C++ allows both overriding and shadowing of inherited
methods, which I suppose could be integrated into your semantics as well.

Since FHJ does not support overloading, it's model is much simpler than C++, so there's no concern 
of distinguishing overriding and shadowing of inherited methods. But we agree that it could be interesting
to add this feature.

Sorry that we didn't make it clear. The term "original method" is supposed to be relative to
"hierarchical overriding method". It does include overrides and maybe a better name (for example
"own method"?) is needed.

> - I like the diagrams in Figure 3, very helpful!

> Sec. 3.1:

> Note sure I am a big fan of abusing override self syntax for non-(hierarchical-)override. Wouldn’t

Yes, `I { m() }` is a syntactic sugar for `I { m() override I ... }`. In a real language, this should be 
supported. But in formlization, for simplicity, we union them into one.

> Footnote 4: “new I()()” — macro fail?

For footnote 4, the version submitted is "In Java the corresponding syntax is new I(){}." Maybe the 
version you have is not updated?

Without (C-FReduce), (C-StaticType) IS infinite. But in (C-FReduce), the condition `e \neq new J()`
prevent the infinite loop.

In Eiffel, programmers still have to rename methods to resolve the conflicts, so I don't think it is a 
different approach and actually you can't keep the method with the SAME name.

The example in "The C++ programming language" and stackoverflow are both similar to the MiddleMan
approach (they have the same spirit, just MiddleMan approach uses parameter types to distinguish
different methods, while the others use separate sets of methods to distinguish).

We agree that this name conflict problem is not quite popular in practice. That's also the reason
why we do not have a big case study in the paper, because we didn't find a senario that
unintentional method conflicts are frequently used in one project.   But once this issue is
encountered, the effect could be severe, and that existing workarounds might not help a lot. And
since the C++ books, the trait paper as well as other papers mentioned this issue, it might be a
sign that this problem is still an interesting issue in certain cases, which worth exploring and
taking into consideration.  Finally our work shows that this feature is lightweight, it does not
complicate the semantics a lot and can be easily added to language models.

As mentioned in Section 1, we have a prototype implementation available here:

- "the method m in J_0 that hierarchically overrides J_1" means, the method m defined like this:
interface J_0 { K m() override J_1 { ... } }

- "e1.J_0@J_1 :: m(e2)" is different from "((J1) e1.m(e2)". The first is a static call while the
second dynamic. The result would be different when the method m gets overridden in an heir of J_0.

- For the question "whether it should be forbidden", we think it is a design choice. If the user
makes  a normal e.m() call, for sure it wouldn't access the super methods. But the static invocation
here gives users the freedom to directly call super methods.

Sorry for the English, what we mean is that the reduction steps follow the reduction rules in FJ-like
languages, where no static types are tracked.

On page 8, "origin" means where the method is defined, we avoid using "original methods" because it
it not introduced yet on page 8. "original method" is a relative concept to hierarchical overriding 
methods.
