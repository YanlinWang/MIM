\begin{abstract}
Multiple inheritance is a valuable feature for Object-Oriented
Programming. However, it is also tricky to get right, as illustrated by
the extensive literature on the topic. A key issue 
is the \emph{ambiguity} arising from inheriting multiple parents,
which can have conflicting methods and fields. 
Numerous existing work provides solutions for 
conflicts which arise from \emph{diamond inheritance}: i.e.
conflicts that arise from implementations sharing a common 
ancestor. However, most mechanisms are inadequate to deal 
with \emph{unintentional method conflicts}: conflicts which 
arise from two unrelated methods that happen to share the same name
and signature. 

\begin{comment}
One of the most promising 
approaches to multiple inheritance is the \emph{trait} model. Traits offer a
restricted model of multiple inheritance that is easy to reason and 
have many elegant properties. Traits have good support for method 
conflicts which arise from \emph{diamond inheritance}:
conflicts that arise from method implementations sharing a common 
ancestor. However, the mechanisms of traits are inadequate to deal 
with \emph{unintentional method conflicts}: conflicts which 
arise from two unrelated methods that happen to share the same name
and signature. 
\end{comment}

This paper presents a new model called \emph{\textbf{F}eatherweight
  \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{J}ava} (\name{}) that deals with
unintentional method conflicts.  In our new model, which is partly
inspired by C++, conflicting methods arising from unrelated methods
can coexist in the same class, and \emph{hierarchical dispatching}
supports unambigous lookups in the presence of such conflicting
methods.  To avoid ambiguity, hierarchical information is employed in
method dispatching, which uses a combination of static and dynamic
type information to choose the implementation of a method at run-time.
Furthermore, unlike all existing inheritance models, our model
supports \emph{hierarchical method overriding}: that is, methods can
be \emph{independently overridden} along the multiple inheritance
hierarchy. We give illustrative examples of our language and features
and formalize \name{} as a minimal Featherweight-Java style calculus.

\begin{comment}
Furthermore we discuss similarities and differences to 


What ensures unambiguity is the use of information about
the class hierarchy.

\name{} is partly inspired by the method resolution semantics
of C++, but it also incoorporates ideas from the trait model and Java
8's default methods. We discuss the similarities
and differences with and also advantages and disadvantages.
