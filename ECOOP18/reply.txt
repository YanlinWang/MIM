"I think multiple overriding needs to be part of the core calculus."

Can we please get this done so that we can reply to him by saying that
we have already done it?

We need to have the extended proofs in a pdf document ofcourse, not just
pen&paper.

#Review 60B

"how it can coexist with solutions for the diamond problem."

Although our model has some differences to the trait model (see discussions in ...),
it is heavily inspired by it! As a result it can pretty much deal with the diamond problem
in the way that traits deal with this problem, although there are a couple of important
differences. In fact, our paper does show examples of the diamond problem and discusses
new issues that arise when hierarchical dispatching/overriding are added.

Did you learn anything from the prototype?

Helpful to have a prototype when we defined earlier versions of the semantics;
also we could double-check that all the examples presented in the paper do
indeed type-check as stated in the last point of the contributions (page 3).

Yanlin/Haoyuan any other things?
